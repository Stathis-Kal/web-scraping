The use of bots to scrap or crawl the web is generally a grey area.

Many many pages out there will block most of the crawlers unless they provide explicit rules, please look at robots.txt file
that typically leave under the base domain for rules and guidelines.
For example: https://github.com/robots.txt

You should be carefull when you are using web crawlers or scraping data from web pages.

In this repo i'm just gonna scrap my personal portofolio web site to find any broken link.
